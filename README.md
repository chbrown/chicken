# Chicken of the VNC

The best free Mac VNC client. Straight `git-svn` port from https://chicken.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/chicken/trunk, because Sourceforge ... is Sourceforge. Mostly, because ``please wait 5 seconds'' to download this file is *not* cool. You know what's cool? Github.

Please download the installer from the "files" section above, or directly, here:
